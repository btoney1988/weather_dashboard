## Weather Dashboard
 - This is a basic weather dashboard. When searching a city user is given the weather and 5-day forecast for that city and the city is saved to a list. When loading back into the weather dashboard you will find the list of searched cities, also displaying the most recent searched cities weather information. Depending on the saftey levels of the UV Index the number displayed will have a background accordingly (green, yellow, orange, red, and purple).
